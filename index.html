                    <h3>📖 How The Legend Was Born</h3>
                    <p class="story-text">
                        Picture this: It's the summer before 10th grade. Young Jason Workman, full of dreams and 
                        questionable decision-making skills, is heading to Georgetown's prestigious summer math program. 
                        The year? Ancient history (but not <em>that</em> ancient). The mission? Create an email address 
                        that would define his digital identity forever.
                    </p>
                    <p class="story-text">
                        The options were limitless. The internet was his oyster. He could have been anything. 
                        <strong>lovebug@</strong>? Too romantic. <strong>dopecapitalguy@</strong>? Too presumptuous 
                        (though accurate, in hindsight). But no—Jason had a vision. A calling. A destiny.
                    </p>
                    <p class="story-text highlight-quote">
                        And thus, <strong>cutelildcboy@hotmail.com</strong> was born. 🎂
                    </p>
                    <p class="story-text">
                        Some say it was confidence. Others say it was self-awareness. We say it was pure, unfiltered 
                        genius. While other teenagers were trying to seem cool with emails like "xxDarkLord420xx" or 
                        "CobraKai1999," Jason proudly proclaimed to the world: "Yes, I AM a cute lil DC boy, and what 
                        of it?"
                    </p>
                    <p class="story-text">
                        Fast forward from that fateful Georgetown summer, and that cute lil' 10th grader has evolved 
                        into the <strong>Data God of DC</strong>. Excel sheets tremble at his approach. Pivot tables 
                        rearrange themselves in his presence. SQL queries optimize out of respect.
                    </p>
                    <p class="story-text">
                        But through all the success, all the data wizardry, all the PowerPoint presentations that have 
                        made grown analysts weep with their beauty—he remains, at his core, exactly what he claimed to be 
                        all those years ago:
                    </p>
                    <p class="story-final">
                        A cute lil' DC boy. Forever and always. 💜
